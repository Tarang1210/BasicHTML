    <p>
      Don’t you just love exploring beautiful and neat sites with a clean user
      interface? While most of us would reply with an assertive ‘YES,’ little,
      do we know the kind of effort and skill that goes into making a website
      attractive and user-friendly. The secret to creating an impressive site is
      to master the art of front-end development, and no, it is not as easy as
      it seems!
    </p>

    <p>
      However, it is not impossible either. Here are five tips that’ll help you
      get better in front-end design and web development.

        <h3>COMMENTING</h3>
        <p>
          Commenting is one such practice that is often ignored by programmers,
          especially for codes that are written by multiple programmers.
          However, comments reduce the cost of knowledge transfer. Name of the
          module, purpose of the module, description of the module, original
          author, modifications and authors who modified code with a description
          on why it was modified were components of an early commenting
          practice.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>GOOD NAMING CONVENTIONS</h3>
        <p>
          Using good naming conventions is the next step to good coding. Often
          developers use Y1 or X1 as variables, and then do not replace them
          with meaningful names. To prevent this confusion and utter waste of
          time, descriptive names should be used.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>SIMPLICITY AND COMPACTNESS</h3>
        <p>
          The key to a good code is also simplicity. To achieve a certain
          result, developers may use complex logic but this should be minimised
          while writing a good code. The next developer who uses the code may
          use it for a different purpose and may not even completely understand
          or utilise the complex logic. Simple code does not always depend on
          the length of the code. The code must also be conceptually simple. An
          added advantage is if the code is also suitably compact. More code can
          be viewed on a page and programmer keystrokes can be reduced.
        </p>

        <h3>PORTABILITY</h3>
        <p>
          Another feature of a good code is portability. If the code contains
          values referring to ‘absolute parameters’ such as file names, URLs or
          IP addresses, it will not run on a host that is of a different design.
          A good programmer will parametrize these variables and configure them
          so the application can also be run and maintained in a different
          environment.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>TESTING</h3>
        <p>
          Testing is also a necessary part in the process of coding. Test cases
          must be planned while the code is being written, and they are
          developed while an application is coded.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>DEBUGGING THE CODE</h3>
        <p>
          While writing a code, it is necessary to check for errors throughout.
          Though it is fine for smaller programs to be debugged after they have
          been written, this becomes a bottleneck for longer programmes. The
          best practice, therefore, is to debug each module as soon as it has
          been created.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>DEPLOYMENT</h3>
        <p>
          Once the code has been written, it has to be deployed. The
          installation files should be kept to a minimum and updated regularly.
          Unused code or anything that is not necessary should not be installed.
